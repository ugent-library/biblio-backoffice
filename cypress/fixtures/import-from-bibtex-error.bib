  abstract     = {{Looking back at over a decade of research by herself and her group, the author advocates the added value of gas phase measurements and the application of mass balances, as well as the synergetic benefits obtained when combining both. The increased application of off-gas measurements for greenhouse gas emission monitoring offers a great opportunity to look at other components in the gas phase, particularly oxygen. Mass balances should not be strictly reserved for modellers but also prove useful while conducting lab experiments and studying full-scale measurement data. Combining off-gas measurements with mass balances may serve not only to quantify greenhouse gas emission factors and aeration efficiency but also to follow dynamic concentration profiles of dissolved components without dedicated sensors and/or to calculate other unmeasured variables. Mass-balance-based data reconciliation allows for obtaining reliable and accurate data, and even more when combined with off-gas analysis.}},
