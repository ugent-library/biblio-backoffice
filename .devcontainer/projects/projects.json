Dit onderzoek wordt uitgevoerd door middel van interviews en een online meet- evaluatie- en interpretatie systeem (eco-questionnaire) en hierbij wordt gebruik gemaakt van de Zelf-determinatie Theorie (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 2000; Vansteenkiste, Ryan, & Deci, 2000), een sterk gevalideerde motivatietheorie die reeds 35 jaar in ontwikkeling is. (fase I - analyse fase: eco-questionnaire)<br>Na het in kaart brengen van de soorten motivaties van bestuurders om al dan niet ecologisch verantwoord en veilig te rijden, wordt een motivationele interventie opgesteld en getoetst. Hierbij wordt nagegaan welke structurele veranderingen in de opleiding die geboden wordt door KDC NV een positieve motivationele verandering met zich mee brengen, zodat bestuurders blijvend er voor kiezen om ecologisch verantwoord en veilig te rijden, ook als de opleiding is afgerond. Het doel van deze interventiestudie is dan ook om de bevindingen te gebruiken om de performantie en efficiëntie van het communicaite- en opleidingssysteem van KDC NV te optimaliseren, met het oog op een blijvende reductie van brandstofverbruik, CO2, schadegevallen en onderhoud</p>","lang":"und"}],"identifiers":[{"value":"01/12/2008","kind":"iweto"}],"attributes":[{"key":"gismo_id","value":"8ef4d53f-971c-4f02-8211-96f7ec4456b4","scope":"gismo"}],"startDate":"2008-12-01","names":[{"lang":"und","value":"Stimuleren van duurzaam ecologisch verantwoord en veilig rijgedrag"}]}
